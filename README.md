# `neuronek-cli`

Main repository is available under [`keinsell/neuronek`](https://github.com/keinsell/neuronek). This repository is more experimental than offical as the official one I would say have trouble with data maintainment over the various applications and offline-first approach.

This repository is a simplified version of the application which will implement basic commands and will be available cross-platform comparing to cli application in main repository.

If the experiments in this repository will be successful code will become upstream and will be available as git submodule in the main repository.
