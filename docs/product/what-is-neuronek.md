# Introducing Neuronek: Your Companion for Conscious Exploration

Neuronek is a revolutionary neurochemistry tracking application designed for psychonauts and biohackers. It empowers users to register intake of psychoactive substances, monitor their pattern and behaviour to safely explore altered states of consciousness and optimize "factory-default" biology.

> Ngl, when you are suffering from ADHD since 13 years old there is no potential possibility to deal with factory default settings and nowadays with all of the research collected I think it application can have a reasonable space in the market (especially when doing ritalin on breakfast become social norm recently, not like I'm proud of this one)

## Potential Directions

### Microdosing dosage tracker

A microdosing dosage tracker is a tool or application that helps individuals who practice microdosing (taking small, sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin) to accurately monitor and record their dosage levels. This can involve features like dose calculators, timers, and logging systems to track the amount of substance consumed, the time of consumption, and any effects experienced. The goal is to ensure consistent and safe microdosing practices, allowing users to find the optimal dose for their individual needs and respond appropriately to any changes in their microdosing regimen.

### Stimtrack

A stimulant dosage tracker with inventory tracking is a digital tool or application that helps individuals who take stimulant medications, such as those prescribed for ADHD, to monitor their dosage and keep track of their medication supply. This system typically includes features like a calendar to log when doses are taken, alerts to remind users to take their medication, and a database to record the quantity and refill dates of their prescriptions. This allows users to better manage their treatment, ensure they are taking the correct dosage, and avoid running out of their medication unexpectedly.

- Prescription Management
- Adherence tracking, he system allows users to log when they have taken their medication, helping them maintain consistent dosage.
- Medication reminders, The tracker can provide alerts to remind users when it's time to take their next dose.
- Tolerance sharing
- Anonymous research contributions
