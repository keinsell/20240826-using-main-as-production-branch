Market Gaps:

While the above applications and services offer valuable resources for harm-reduction, there is a gap in the market for a comprehensive tool that provides real-time monitoring and personalized harm-reduction strategies. Specifically, there is a need for:

    Real-time monitoring: Currently, there are no applications or services that offer real-time monitoring of vital signs and physiological functions during psychoactive substance use. This is a critical gap in the market, as real-time monitoring can provide early warning signs of potential harm and allow for immediate intervention.
    Personalized harm-reduction strategies: While there are several applications and services that offer drug education and resources, there is a need for personalized harm-reduction strategies that take into account individual factors such as age, weight, and medical history.
    Integration with wearable technology: There is an opportunity to integrate harm-reduction strategies with wearable technology, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, to provide real-time monitoring and personalized harm-reduction strategies.

Neuronek has the potential to fill these gaps in the market by providing a comprehensive tool that offers real-time monitoring, personalized harm-reduction strategies, and integration with wearable technology. By focusing on these key areas, Neuronek can differentiate itself from existing applications and services and provide value to its target audience of psychonauts and biohackers.
