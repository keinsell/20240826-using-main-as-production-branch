# 1. "Scratching down a simple ingestion log"

There was previous version of CLI version that I was using for quite long time, but since as it's often happens in my case I've lost access to data after moving from one machine to another, in such process I've decided to change conception a little bit and rewrite application from scratch with iterative approach.

## Goal

Simple ingestion management system which would allow for creating, listing, updating and deleting ingestions stored in a any form of local database.

### Requirements

- Have a software deliverable as binary CLI application available to be downloaded through GitHub Releases and be available for `linux_x86_64` platform.
- Delivered application should allow to store and read information about ingestions.
